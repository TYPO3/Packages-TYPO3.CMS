===============================================================================
Compatibility
===============================================================================

* Deprecated methods

Deprecated methods that were initially targeted to be removed in TYPO3 4.8/6.0
have finally been removed. The deprecation log shows which functions were
declared to be deprecated and will be removed in the next TYPO3 versions.

* Removed classes prior to scheduled deprecation removal

t3lib_BEDisplayLog: This class was used only by the old belog module, its
functionality is now encapsulated in EXT:belog itself. Since it is very
unlikely that the class was used by other external extensions, the file was
removed instead of deprecating it.

Removed Functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Removed doNotLoadInFE flag

With TYPO3 4.3 the flag doNotLoadInFE flag was introduced in ext_emconf.php
extension files to hint the core that an extension has no frontend
functionality. The performance gain of this change in the frontend was minimal.
The flag is now removed and the according extList_FE setting in localconf.php
has no effect anymore.
