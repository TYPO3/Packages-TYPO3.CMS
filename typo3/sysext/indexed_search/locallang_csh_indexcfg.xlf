        <source>The Indexed Search configuration allows you to set up indexing of resources which are external to the TYPO3 page tree.

        <source>&lt;b&gt;Records&lt;/b&gt; - You will be able to index records on a specified page from a specified database table. You can determine which fields from that record you want to index and how additional GET parameters should look like when linking to the search result.
&lt;b&gt;Files&lt;/b&gt; - Allows you to index a whole directory of files from the fileadmin/ folder. You can optionally specify how many levels of recursion you want.
&lt;b&gt;External URL&lt;/b&gt; - Allows you to index an external site and search it from your TYPO3 installation! You can specify how deep the crawler should go on that external URL.
&lt;b&gt;Page tree&lt;/b&gt; - Allows you to index the page tree using the cron script. This type will not be useful as a category for searching like the other types.
&lt;b&gt;Meta configuration&lt;/b&gt; - Points to a collection of other indexing configurations in which the search will be done. Cannot be used for cron-job based indexing.
&lt;b&gt;Custom&lt;/b&gt; - Other extensions might register custom types of configurations.</source>
